## Topicï¼š Diabetes Prediction

### Introduction:

Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that affects a significant portion of the global population. Early detection and accurate prediction of diabetes are crucial for timely intervention and the implementation of preventive measures. In recent years, the integration of regression and machine learning techniques has emerged as a promising approach to predicting diabetes and identifying patterns related to the disease. In this study, we aim to explore the use of regression and machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes and investigate various factors associated with its occurrence.

#### Question:
How can we use regression and machine learning techniques to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on their age, BMI, smoking history, heart disease, hypertension, blood glucose levels and other independent variables?

#### Dataset

- Original data:
The Main dataset is huge. you can find on the CDC's official website. This is the link:https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2021.html

- Cleaned data:
**diabetes_health_indicators_BRFSS2021.csv is the cleaned data.**
