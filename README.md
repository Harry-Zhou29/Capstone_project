## Topicï¼š Diabetes Prediction

### Introduction:

Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that affects a significant portion of the global population. Early detection and accurate prediction of diabetes are crucial for timely intervention and the implementation of preventive measures. In recent years, the integration of regression and machine learning techniques has emerged as a promising approach to predicting diabetes and identifying patterns related to the disease. In this study, we aim to explore the use of regression and machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes and investigate various factors associated with its occurrence.

#### Question:
How can we use regression and machine learning techniques to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on their age, BMI, smoking history, heart disease, hypertension, blood glucose levels and other independent variables?

I will train and evaluate regression models (e.g., logistic regression) and machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines) using the provided dataset in this study. We will assess the performance of each approach by measuring their accuracy in predicting diabetes based on the given features.
